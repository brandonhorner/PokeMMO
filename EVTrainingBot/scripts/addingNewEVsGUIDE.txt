To add a new EV type to the bot, you need to:

1. Add a new folder to the EVTrainingBot\images folder with the exact name of the "evType". (for example: EVTrainingBot\images\specialAtk)
    There should be enough in there but you can always add more regions!

2. Add screenshots:
    1. Go to the EV training spot for that EV type, grab a screenshot of you in the spot.
    2. This will be used in the initial GUI to help YOU get to the starting position of the script next time you run it.
    3. Drop the screenshot in paint 3D (as a 2d image), click crop, set the canvas size to 863px by 531px.
    4. Open your town map from where you are standing, and grab a screenshot of the map around you, overlay the picture at the upper left of the canvas.
    5. Grab a snippet of the name of the area and place that above the map in the canvas.
    6. Save the image as "startingLocation.png" in the EVTrainingBot\images\evType folder.

3. Add code to the EVTrainingBot.ahk file to handle the new EV type.
    1. flyToPokecenter() needs to be updated, starting from the EV training spot, open your town map and see what keys are needed to be pressed
    2. returnToEVTrainingSpot() needs to be updated with the path from the Pokecenter to the startlocation.png
        You can use modify testEVTrainingPathing() to your liking. 5 successful loops = 95% chance of being at the EV training spot. :D
        You can use the test_utilities.ahk file to visually see the screenAreas that are being checked.
    3. nurseInteraction() will occasionally need to be updated if you're in a weird pokemon center.

4. Add a new button to the EVTrainingBotGUI.ahk file to start the new EV training routine.



Still need to do:
    - Add a "back" button to the EVTrainingBotGUI.ahk file to return to the main menu.
    - Add a prerequisites section to the README.txt file.
    - Implement Special Defense EV training.
